# Data Science Capstone - IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This is the Capstone Project for the IBM Applied Data Science Professional Certification. 
The dataset explored is based on the launch sector in the Space industry.

## Business understanding

The Falcon 9 rocket is owned by SpaceX and is advertised at a cost of 62 million dollars; while other providers cost up to 165 million dollars each. The difference in saving cost is because SpaceX can re-use the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. 

Therefore, if we can deduce whether the first stage will land or not, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used by an alternate company looking to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This project will implement machine learning techniques to identify the key features that determine a successful launch, and ultimately, predict if the Space X Falcon 9â€™s first stage will successfully land.
